Project Overview
The "TudoGostoso" project is a simple, static webpage designed to showcase various food-related sections. The webpage includes a navigational menu, sections dedicated to different types of recipes, and links to additional resources. The primary goal of this project is to provide an organized and user-friendly interface for users interested in exploring different food categories and popular recipes.

File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the "TudoGostoso" webpage.
formatacao.css: A linked CSS file that styles the HTML elements (this file is referenced but not included in the provided code).
Features
Header and Title

The webpage's title is "TudoGostoso," displayed prominently as an <h1> tag.
A horizontal line (<hr>) separates the title from the content below.
Navigation Menu

An organized index section allows users to navigate to different parts of the site easily.
Each item in the index is wrapped in an <a> tag linking to various pages (e.g., canaisEspeciais.html, noticias.html, etc.).
A placeholder <li> is present for "Todas as Receitas," which currently has no link.
Content Sections

Lorem Ipsum: A placeholder section using the standard "Lorem ipsum" text for demonstration.
Importance of Food: An informative section about the role of food, with a citation from the National Geographic Society.
Back to Top Link

At the end of the "Lorem Ipsum" section, there is a link allowing users to return to the top of the page.
Popular Recipes

A section titled "RECEITAS MAIS POPULARES" lists popular recipes in an unordered list (<ul>), with each item being a clickable link (though without an actual URL).
Contact Us

A "Contact Us" section provides a link to a contact page (contactus.html) and an external link to the TudoGostoso website for more information.
Usage Instructions
Viewing the Webpage: Open the index.html file in any modern web browser to view the webpage.
Navigation: Click on the links in the index section to navigate to different recipe categories. Note that this example assumes corresponding HTML files for each section (e.g., bolosETortas.html).
Contact Information: Use the "Contact Us" link to navigate to the contact page or visit the TudoGostoso website for additional resources.
Dependencies
CSS Styling: The project references a CSS file (formatacao.css) for styling, which should be located in the same directory as the HTML file. Ensure that this file exists to see the styled version of the page.
Future Improvements
Add Links: Implement actual links for the "Popular Recipes" section and the "Todas as Receitas" item in the index.
CSS Enhancements: Expand the styling in formatacao.css to improve the visual appeal of the site.
Content Development: Replace the placeholder text with actual content and consider adding more sections or interactive elements.
Credits
Content Source: The "Importance of Food" section includes information from the National Geographic Society.
Inspiration: The project is inspired by the TudoGostoso platform, a popular Brazilian website for recipes.
